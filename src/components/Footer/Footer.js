            <strong>About Us:</strong> MyStockAI uses AI deep learning
            algorithms for stock price prediction. MyStockAI is one of the many
            AI products from Kalpra Tech Solutions, a TX based start-up from
            USA. The revolution in AI and the availability of huge volumes of
            historical data (for the last 5-10 years stock prices) helps the
            analysts and individual stock traders to take better decisions. At
            MyStockAI, our main value is the intellectual honesty. Our results
            and performances are not biased. Any signal provided by
            AIStockFinder will remain in its database, having been an
            unsuccessful trade or a successful one. At the end of the day,
            trading the equity market is a probabilistic game and only a
            market-outperforming algorithm is worth trading.
